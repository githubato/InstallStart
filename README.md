#InstallStart
##The most important script for a new Ubuntu installation

This is a very simple script that installs the most important normal-user applications and packages
for your Debian or Ubuntu based OS.

```
git clone "https://github.com/githubato/InstallStart" && \
sh InstallStart/Install.sh && \
sh InstallStart/Configuration.sh 
```

Only woking with Ubuntu or Debian-like distributions
Read "Install.sh" and "Configuration.sh" to learn more.
