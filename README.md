# InstallStart
##The most important script for a new Ubuntu installation
####(Only woking with Ubuntu or Debian-like distributions)

This is a very simple script that installs the most important normal-user applications and packages
for your Debian or Ubuntu based Linux OS (like Linux Mint or Ubuntu itself).
Furthermore, I added some developer and security packages as well.

The script is very self-explaining.
Feel free to add your own favourite lines respectively programs for Debian/Ubuntu.

For the best experience, please use an distribution version comparable to Ubuntu 14.04 or greater.
To get fast access to all your favourite applications after the OS installation, 
type the following lines in your terminal:


####sudo apt-get install git --yes
####git clone "https://github.com/gitoidevelopment/InstallStart"
####cd InstallStart/
####sudo sh InstallStart.sh --yes


This code places the InstallStart script right on your disk and executes it subsequently.)

Thanks,
