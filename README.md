# InstallStart
##The most important script for a new Ubuntu installation
####(Only woking with Ubuntu or Debian-like distributions)

This is a very simple script that installs the most important normal-user applications and packages
for your Debian or Ubuntu based Linux OS (like Linux Mint or Ubuntu itself).
Furthermore, I added some developer and security packages as well.

The script is very self-explaining.
Feel free to add your own favourite lines respectively programs for Debian/Ubuntu.

For the best experience, please use an distribution version comparable to Ubuntu 14.04 or greater.

Thanks,
